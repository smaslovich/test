              Maximize your space and your revenue by renting out your unused dental office

              space. With recent changes in the dental industry, you may find that your revenue

              and patient list may be cut while the size of your office remains the same. Keep

              your bottom line healthy and maximize your operating capacity by generating

              additional income from the extra space in your office.

              With changes in the dental and insurance industries and the rising costs of tuition
              and property, young professionals are finding it harder and harder to start their
              own practice.
              You can help young entrepreneurs get their start by assisting them
              through MyMediSpace.
              By renting out your unused office space or even just a
              chair within your office, you can generate income for yourself and help a dentist
              who is just starting out.
              MyMediSpace is dedicated to providing all the necessary
              tools young professionals need to get their practice up and running so they can be

              Renting and selling space in the dental industry is a common practice, however,

              this traditionally carries a hefty price tag. First you have to take valuable time

              finding the right broker and then, once you do, there are broker fees, finder fees

              and other hidden and unforeseen costs just waiting to drain your bank account.
            </p>
            <p>
              MyMediSpace is doing away with this by streamlining this process and passing on

              the time and cost savings to you. We take you from initial listing to final rental or

              sale agreement in order to keep costs low and to make sure you get the best rate

              without taking out more time from your packed schedule.

              In an ideal world you would always have the exact amount of each supply you

              need on hand. Unfortunately, patient flow and types of procedures can’t always

              be predicted, so many dentists find themselves with an overwhelming amount of

              some inventory, yet scrambling to reorder on other items.
              Now you can reduce waste and put valuable materials to use by including supplies
              with the space you list for rent!

              General practitioners and dental specialists all serve a vital role in the

              industry and each provides unique skills. Unfortunately, referring patients to

              other specialists means a loss of revenue. Because of this some dentists

              underestimate the complexity of a procedure and attempt to perform it

              themselves. On the other hand, attempting to perform the work yourself

              without specialized training or equipment. This can be dangerous to your

              patient and even lead to legal action. For many years the only options were

              to attempt the work yourself which opens your practice up to the risk of a

              lawsuit or to refer patients to a specialist.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now there’s another way that benefits specialists and general practitioners.

              With MyMediSpace you can have access to specialists on a shared

              revenue plan or pay specialists on a daily or as-needed basis. Select from

              strategic revenue share techniques in order to enhance your practice and

              keep revenue in-house. This enhances your patients’ care while also

              maximizing productivity for all dental professionals involved.
            </p>
            <p>
              This mutually beneficial relationship reduces the risks associated with

              misjudging the complexity of dental treatments while providing additional

              work to specialists. A properly cultivated partnership will provide years of

              trusted service and enhanced revenue along with optimal patient care. Stop

              referring and start growing your partnership today for a better practice

              tomorrow!
